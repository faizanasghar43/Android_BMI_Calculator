# BMI Calculator App

This is a simple BMI calculator app that calculates your body mass index (BMI) using either the imperial or metric formula. It was built using Java and Android Studio as a part of my Mobile App Development Course.

The app has the following features:

    A simple user interface with input fields for height and weight
    Allows the user to select between imperial or metric mode
    Calculates the BMI using the selected formula (imperial: weight / (height * height) * 703, metric: weight / (height * height))
    Displays the calculated BMI on the screen
    Displays a message that describes the calculated BMI, such as "Underweight", "Normal weight", "Overweight", or "Obese"
